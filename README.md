# Web3 bridge membership app

### QUESTION 1:
"Web3Bridge has started a peer exercise/workout program. Both participants and
facilitators are taking part in this peer exercise program.
To encourage each other, we shall need a leaderboard where the top participants
in the workout program appear after each iteration of exercise taken. The exercise will
be self paced and determined by the steps taken by each individual in each iteration.
Participants are responsible for updating their leaderboard with the steps they
have taken in each iteration. An iteration is a simulation of a period which could be
represented as an hour, 6 hours or a day.
The leaderboard shall start out empty and can only accommodate the top 10
participants. Each Participant will be uniquely identified by a web3bridge id number.
They should input an id number, their name and number of steps taken after each
iteration in order to appear on the leaderboard.
A participant will be allowed to continuously add steps towards a new iteration,
i.e After a participant has added their steps for iteration 1, They can go ahead and add
steps for iteration 2 and this will move them up on the leaderboard. For testing
purposes, we shall only consider 4 iterations."

### Answer
step1: Define an javascript object block of employee
step2: Asign ID to employee id and attributes
step3: create a javascript function to define the leaderboard for exercise program
step4: the function call should check for the leaderboard criteria
step5: iterate and update the leaderboard
